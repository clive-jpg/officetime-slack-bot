# OfficeTime Slack Bot ðŸ•’

**OfficeTime** is a lightweight Slack bot that responds to the `/officetime` command by showing current local times across key office locations to the user silently. Requires no external API calls, making commands efficient.

It uses Python, Slack Bolt, and emoji-based city icons. Currently, Websocket (persistent) based slack app is supported. (TBA)
