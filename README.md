# OfficeTime Slack Bot ðŸ•’ 

***OfficeTime*** is a lightweight Slack bot that responds to the slack /officetime command by showing current local times across key office locations.

This was my first projectâ€”built to explore Python, get comfortable with GitHub, and try out AWS services like Lambda and EC2, along with the Slack API. It doesnâ€™t use any external web APIsâ€”just Python timezone modules.

Both Socket Mode and AWS Lambda versions are includedâ€”check the files to see whatâ€™s needed for each.

README in Progress - More setup details soon!

 Example output of the `/officetime` command.  
> The bot shows local times across key office locations using emojis and timezone-aware formatting.  
> The response is sent as an ephemeral message (visible only to the user who triggered the command).

## Features

- Slash command `/officetime`
- Timezone-aware via Pythonâ€™s `zoneinfo`
- Emoji-themed output for each city
- Ephemeral messages (only shown to you)
- Customisable list of cities and emojis

## Setup (In Progress)

### Slack App Scopes (Set in your Slack Admin > OAuth & Permissions):
- `commands` â€“ to register the `/officetime` slash command
- `chat:write` â€“ to send messages on behalf of the bot

### Slash Command:
- **Command:** `/officetime`


## Common Issues

- Ensure that python module dependencies are installed
- Ensure that bot and app tokens match on slack admin
- Ensure /slashcommand in app permissions is to 'officetime' to enable app

## Upcoming

- Creation of App Manifest file for easy app creation (Easy setup)

_Thanks for checking this out! README is still in progress â€” more updates soon._
