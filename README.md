# OfficeTime Slack Bot ðŸ•’ 

***OfficeTime*** is a lightweight Slack bot that responds to the slack /officetime command by showing current local times across key office locations.

This was my first projectâ€”built to explore Python, get comfortable with GitHub, and try out AWS services like Lambda and EC2, along with the Slack API. It doesnâ€™t use any external web APIsâ€”just Python timezone modules.

Both Socket Mode and AWS Lambda versions are includedâ€”check the files to see whatâ€™s needed for each.
